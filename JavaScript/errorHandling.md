# Error Handling

# Runtime Errors
  - ReferenceError: when a variable or function cannot be found
  - TypeError: when a value is not a valid type

# Constructing an Error
  - JavaScript errors are objects that have a name and message property
  - What if we want to throw an error that is not covered by the built in errors?
  - Can use the "Error()" function to make our own error object
