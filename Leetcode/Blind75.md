# Blind 75 - LeetCode

  - Blind 75 was designed by [Yangshun Tay](https://github.com/yangshun) and can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/) or on the [technical interview handbook website](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/).
  - With this repo, I want to store my solutions, but more importantly, my thought process on how I got to them
  - I am hoping this will help me better understand the solutions to the problems, especially the ones I need assistance with

## 9) [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
  - Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets ```[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]``` such that ```i != j, i != k, and j != k,``` and ```nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0```
  - Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets  
  
  **Example:**
  ```
    Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
    Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
    Explanation: 
    nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
    nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
    nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
    The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
    Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
```
  **Solution:**
  ```Python
    print()
  ```
