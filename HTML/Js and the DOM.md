#  JavaScript and the DOM

## The Document Keyword
  - The 'document' object allows you to access the root node of the DOM tree
  - Before you can access any element, you must access the document structure itself
  - 'document' object allows you to access the children of the DOM as properties
    - ex: document.body 

## Tweaking Elements
  - When accessing an element through the DOM, you also have access to all of its properties
  - This means modifying the contents, as well as the attributes and properties
  ```JavaScript
    document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>Adding a heading</h1>'
  ```
  - The '.innerHTML' property allows you to access and set the contents of an element
  - Can also add any valid HTML elements

## Select and Modify Elements
  - The DOM allows us to select and edit elements with CSS selectors
  -
