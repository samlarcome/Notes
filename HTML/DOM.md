# DOM

## What is the DOM?
  - Document Object Model
  - Tree like structure that allows us to conceptualize hierarchy and access elements on web page
  - Logical tree like Model that organizes a websites HTML Document as and Object
  - Allows Js to access, update, and modify structure of a website's html
  - "link between html webpage and scripting language"

## The DOM as a Tree Structure
  - DOM tree follows similar logic of a family tree
  - A node is a point in the tree that contains data
  - The root node represents the html document (document)
  - The descendants are the html tag, followed by the head and body tag

## Nodes and Elements in the DOM
  - A node is an intersecting point in the tree that contains data
  - Many types of nodes in the DOM tree
    - Element Nodes -> represent HTML elements 
    - Text Nodes -> represent text inside HTML elements

## Attributes of Elements Nodes
  - DOM allows us to access a nodes attributes (class, id, style...)
  - Can tweak their values or just check their value in the code
