# HTML Forms

## How a Form Works
  - Computers need HTTP request to know how to communicate
  - HTTP instructs computer how to handle incoming information
  - <form> element is a great tool for collecting information
  - Need to supply <form> with both the location of where the information is supposed to go, and what HTTP request to make
  
  ```html
    <form action = "./example.html" method = "POST"></form>
  ```
